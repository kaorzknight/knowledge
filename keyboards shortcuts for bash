    Ctrl+Z suspend the current foreground process running in bash. This sends the       
            SIGTSTP signal to the process. To return the process to the foreground later, use the fg process_name command

    Ctrl+D close the bash shell this sends an EOF ( end of file )
            this similar to running the exit command 
        
Controlling the Screen

    Ctrl+L Clear the screen. This similar to running the "clear" command
    
    Ctrl+S Stop all output to screen. This is particular useful when running            
            commands with a lot of long, verbose output, but you don't want to stop the command it self with Ctrl+C

    Ctrl+Q Resume output to the screen after stopping it with Ctrl+S

        cursor. This allow you to press Ctrl+XX to return to the start of the line, change something, and then press Ctrl+XX to go back to your original position. To use this shortcut, hold the Ctrl key and tap the X key twice.
