 
What is a VPN? 

    A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that lets you access the web safely and privately by routing your connection through a server and hiding your online actions.
    
How does a VPN work?

    You start the VPN client (software) from your VPN service. This software encrypts your data, even before your Internet Service Provider or the coffee shop WIFI provider sees it. The data then goes to the VPN, and fron the VPN server to your online destination - anything from your bank website to a video sharing website to a search engine. The online destination sees your data as coming from the VPN server and its location, and not from your computer and your location. 
    
    The internet is a collection of servers responsible for storing websites and serving them to anyone who wants to view them.Those servers talk with each other all the time, including sharing your data with each other to ultimately let you browse a page. Great for you to be able to surf, but not great for privacy.
    
    Going online is like taking a commercial airline flight. The ticket agent, buggage handlers, security personnel, and flight attendants all need pieces of data to get you routed between cities. A similar of information happens on the web.
    
    If it is a fun website that you are looking at then no need to worry. It doesn't matter if someone sees your data. But if it's online banking, buisiness email, or anything else that's a bit more sensitive - it is a different story.
    
    When you use a VPN service, your data is encrypted (because you are using their app) goes in encrypted form to your ISP(Internet Service Provider) then to VPN server. The VPN server is the third party that connects to the web on your behalf. This solves the privacy and security problem for us in a couple of ways:
    
        - The destination site sees the VPN server as the traffic origin, not you.
        - No one can (easily) identify you or your computer as the source of the        
            data ,nor what you're doing (what website you're visiting, what data you're transferring, etc.)
        - Your data is encrypted, so even if someone does look at what you are 
            sending, they only see encrypted enformation and not raw data.
            
    How secure is a VPN
    
        VPN security causes debate among IT pros and others in the industry, and no two serveices are identical in their offerings or security. There are two main factors :
        
            - The limitations of the type of VPN technology used by a provider.
            - Legal and policy limitations affecting what can be done with that 
                technology. The laws of the company's own policies affect how the company implements this technology in their service.
                
    VPN protocols
    
        VPN protocols define how the service handles data transmission over a VPN. The most common protocols are PPTP, L2TP, SSTP, IKEV2 and OpenVPN. 
        
            - PPTP (Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol). 
                
                This is one of the oldest protocols in use, originally designed by Microsoft.
                    Pros: works on old computers, is a part of the Windows  
                            operatig system, and it's easy to set up.
                    Cons: by today's standards, it's barely secure.
                            **AVOID A PROVIDER IF THIS IS THE ONLY PROTOCOL OFFERED**
                    
            - L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol). 
            
                This is a combination of PPTP and Cisco's L2F protocol. The concept of this protocol is sound - it uses keys to establish a secure connection on each end of your data tunnel - but the execution isn't very safe. The addition of the IPsec protocol improves security a bit, but there are 'reports of NSA's alleged ability' to break this protocol and see what's being transmitted. No matter if those are actually true, the fact that there's a debate at all is perhaps enough to AVOID THIS AS WELL
                
            - SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol). 
            
                This is another Microsoft-built protocol. The connection is established with some SSL/TNS encryption (the de facto* standard for web encryption these days). SSL's and TLS's strength is built on symmetric-key cryptography; a setup in which only the two parties involved in the transfer can decode data within. 
                ** OVER ALL, SSTP IS A VERY SECURE SOLUTION ** 
                
            
                
                
                
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
    * De Facto Standard คือซอฟแวร์หรือฮาร์ดแวร์ ที่ถือกันว่าเป็นมาตรฐานเป็นที่รู้กันเอง ยอมรับกันเอง โดยไม่มีประกาศอย่างเป็นทางการ เช่น ในวงการคอมพิวเจอร์ยอมรับกันว่า คอมพิวเตอร์ IBM เป็น คอมพิวเตอร์มาตรฐาน คอมพิวเตอร์ยี่ห้ออื่นๆ จึงทำให้สามารถใช้ร่วมกับคอมพิวเตอร์ IBM ได้ จึงเรียกคอมพิวเตอร์เหล่านั้นว่า IBM clone หรือ IBM compatible
    ส่วน De jure standards คือ มาตรฐานที่ไม่มีการระบุว่าคนใดคนหนึ่งถูกต้อง แต่เกิดจากการเชื่อมร่วมกันจนเป็นสาธารณะ ตัวอย่างเช่น TCP/IP องค์กรที่ดูแลมาตรฐาน ISO, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), และอื่นๆ
